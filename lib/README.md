# ðŸ©¹ Sitecore.Support.205766

The improved marketing controls in this repository use Sitecore's built-in
`TreeList` control to render marketing events for selection. Sitecore support
patch [`Sitecore.Support.205766`][1] fixes an issue with the built-in `TreeList`
control where it does not hide items set in the `TreeList`'s
`ExcludeItemsFromDisplay` property (e.g., marketing events that haven't yet
been deployed).

See the [support repository on GitHub for this patch][1] for more information.
